# Random-Recipe-Selector
(STILL A WIP, ALL PUSHES/COMMITS WILL BE DONE IN MAJOR QUANTITIES)

Random Recipe Selector is a meal plan app that includes several recipes from different cuisines. If you are asking yourself, "Hey, what should I eat?", this app will help you answer that question. The criteria/filters to determine what you should eat are as follows:
- Time (# of days)
- Cuisine (# of cuisines)
- Calorie Count (MAYBE)
- Amt. of Servings
- (Not likely) Cuisine Regulation/Consistency (how much each cuisine contributes to the meal plan)

This project is being done in free time as an inexperienced intern, so do not expect anything fancy/fast/completed.
